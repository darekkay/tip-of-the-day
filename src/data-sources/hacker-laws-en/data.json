      "content": "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law\">Amdahl's Law on Wikipedia</a></p><blockquote><p>Amdahl's Law is a formula which shows the <em>potential speedup</em> of a computational task which can be achieved by increasing the resources of a system. Normally used in parallel computing, it can predict the actual benefit of increasing the number of processors, which is limited by the parallelisability of the program.</p></blockquote><p>Best illustrated with an example. If a program is made up of two parts, part A, which must be executed by a single processor, and part B, which can be parallelised, then we see that adding multiple processors to the system executing the program can only have a limited benefit. It can potentially greatly improve the speed of part B - but the speed of part A will remain unchanged.</p><p>The diagram below shows some examples of potential improvements in speed:</p><img width=\"480px\" alt=\"Diagram: Amdahl's Law\" src=\"https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws/raw/master/images/amdahls_law.png\" /><p><em>(Image Reference: By Daniels219 at English Wikipedia, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AmdahlsLaw.svg)</em></p><p>As can be seen, even a program which is 50% parallelisable will benefit very little beyond 10 processing units, whereas a program which is 95% parallelisable can still achieve significant speed improvements with over a thousand processing units.</p><p>As <a href=\"#moores-law\">Moore's Law</a> slows, and the acceleration of individual processor speed slows, parallelisation is key to improving performance. Graphics programming is an excellent example - with modern Shader based computing, individual pixels or fragments can be rendered in parallel - this is why modern graphics cards often have many thousands of processing cores (GPUs or Shader Units).</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li><a href=\"#brooks-law\">Brooks' Law</a></li><li><a href=\"#moores-law\">Moore's Law</a></li></ul>"

Brooks is clear that this is an over-simplification, however, the general reasoning is that given the ramp up time of new resources and the communication overheads, in the immediate short-term velocity decreases. Also, many tasks may not be divisible, i.e. easily distributed between more resources, meaning the potential velocity increase is also lower.</p><p>The common phrase in delivery &quot;Nine women can't make a baby in one month&quot; relates to Brooks' Law, in particular, the fact that some kinds of work are not divisible or parallelisable.</p><p>This is a central theme of the book '<a href=\"#reading-list\">The Mythical Man Month</a>'.</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li><a href=\"#todo\">Death March</a></li><li><a href=\"#reading-list\">Reading List: The Mythical Man Month</a></li></ul>"

Dunbar's number is not only important to keep in mind as an office grows, but also when setting the scope for team efforts or deciding when a system should invest in tooling to assist in modeling and automating logistical overhead.

The file system APIs are an <em>abstraction</em> of the lower level kernel systems, which are themselves an abstraction over the physical processes relating to changing data on a magnetic platter (or flash memory for an SSD). In most cases, the abstraction of treating a file like a stream of binary data will work. However, for a magnetic drive, reading data sequentially will be <em>significantly</em> faster than random access (due to increased overhead of page faults), but for an SSD drive, this overhead will not be present. Underlying details will need to be understood to deal with this case (for example, database index files are structured to reduce the overhead of random access), the abstraction 'leaks' implementation details the developer may need to be aware of.</p><p>The example above can become more complex when <em>more</em> abstractions are introduced. The Linux operating system allows files to be accessed over a network but represented locally as 'normal' files. This abstraction will 'leak' if there are network failures. If a developer treats these files as 'normal' files, without considering the fact that they may be subject to network latency and failures, the solutions will be buggy.</p><p>The article describing the law suggests that an over-reliance on abstractions, combined with a poor understanding of the underlying processes, actually makes dealing with the problem at hand <em>more</em> complex in some cases.</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li><a href=\"#hyrums-law-the-law-of-implicit-interfaces\">Hyrum's Law</a></li></ul><p>Real-world examples:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forums.adobe.com/thread/376152\">Photoshop Slow Startup</a> - an issue I encountered in the past.

This principle suggests that modules or classes should do one thing and one thing only. In more practical terms, this means that a single, small change to a feature of a program should require a change in one component only.

Knowing that a component which is being changed has a single responsibility only means that <em>testing</em> that change should be easier. Using the earlier example, changing the password complexity component should only be able to affect the features which relate to password complexity. It can be much more difficult to reason about the impact of a change to a component which has many responsibilities.</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li><a href=\"#todo\">Object-Oriented Programming</a></li><li><a href=\"#solid\">SOLID</a></li></ul>"

This principle states that higher level orchestrating components should not have to know the details of their dependencies.</p><p>As an example, imagine we have a program which read metadata from a website. We would assume that the main component would have to know about a component to download the webpage content, then a component which can read the metadata. If we were to take dependency inversion into account, the main component would depend only on an abstract component which can fetch byte data, and then an abstract component which would be able to read metadata from a byte stream. The main component would not know about TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML, etc.</p><p>This principle is complex, as it can seem to 'invert' the expected dependencies of a system (hence the name). In practice, it also means that a separate orchestrating component must ensure the correct implementations of abstract types are used (e.g. in the previous example, <em>something</em> must still provide the metadata reader component a HTTP file downloader and HTML meta tag reader).
